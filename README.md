# Sleeping-Efficiency-Analyses
## Purposes:
The purpose of this analysis is to investigate the effective factors in sleep and the extent of their influence on the quality of people's sleep. By analyzing the obtained correlations, we were able to find the main factors and check their impact.
### About Sleep Cycle ðŸ›Œ
Usually, REM sleep happens 90 minutes after you fall asleep. The first period of REM typically lasts 10 minutes. Each of your later REM stages gets longer, and the final one may last up to an hour. Your heart rate and breathing quickens. You can have intense dreams during REM sleep, since your brain is more active. REM is important because it stimulates the areas of the brain that help with learning and is associated with increased production of proteins Babies can spend up to 50% of their sleep in the REM stage, compared to only about 20% for adults.

### What is deep sleep?
Although all the stages of sleep are necessary, deep sleep is especially important for brain health and function. This stage of sleep helps the brain rest and recover, allowing it to replenish energy. It also plays a role in the reinforcement of declarative memory, or remembering facts. Deep sleep also contributes to keeping hormones balanced. The pituitary gland secretes human growth hormone during this stage, which helps tissues in the body grow and regenerate cells.

### What is Light Sleep?
When you sleep, your body goes through several sleep cycles comprised of four sleep stages. The first of these is light sleep. Together, these make-up roughly half of a typical night of sleep. This is typically the beginning of the sleep cycle as we transition from full wakefulness to light sleep. In total, you spend about half of your total sleep time in light sleep.

### About Dataset
The dataset contains information about a group of test subjects and their sleep patterns. Each test subject is identified by a unique "Subject ID" and their age and gender are also recorded. The "Bedtime" and "Wakeup time" features indicate when each subject goes to bed and wakes up each day, and the "Sleep duration" feature records the total amount of time each subject slept in hours. The "Sleep efficiency" feature is a measure of the proportion of time spent in bed that is actually spent asleep. The "REM sleep percentage", "Deep sleep percentage", and "Light sleep percentage" features indicate the amount of time each subject spent in each stage of sleep. The "Awakenings" feature records the number of times each subject wakes up during the night. Additionally, the dataset includes information about each subject's caffeine and alcohol consumption in the 24 hours prior to bedtime, their smoking status, and their exercise frequency.
